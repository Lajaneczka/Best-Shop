# Best-Shop
Workshop to practice advanced HTML and CSS skills

## Admission to the BestShop workshop
As you already know, choosing a workshop is to create a one-page BestShop page. It is a presentation page of a company that offers online store management services and the appropriate software for this workshop.

## Technologies 
HTML 5 
CSS

## Setup
Download file zasoby_do_rpjektu.zip 

## Features
### Dimensions
The page content should be 1352px. The .container class should have this width. The backgrounds of each section are to be edge-to-edge in our settings dialog.

Try not to give the rigid elements width or height. Choosing the right paddings and margins will give the desired effect, and it will be the easiest for you when changing the location to the page.

### The colors
The following colors were used in the design:

Color-primary # 08A6E4

Primary used for shadows (color-primary-shadow) rgba (7, 172, 230, .16)

Red accent (color-redish) # FB3B64

Green accent (color-green) # 55DFB4

Black (color-black) # 000000

Gray (color-gray) # A5A5A5

Light gray (color-light-gray) # F7F7F7

White (color-white) #FFFFFF

### Units
All the units we have learned so far can be used in the project.

em, rem - set font size or line height
vw, vh - when we need to force an element to have a relative width or height relative to the screen size (useful when the section is to occupy 100% of the screen height)
px - margins, paddings, shadows, borders, etc.

### Fonts
The fonts used in the project are:

Raleway [300, 400, 700, 800]
Open Sans [300, 400, 700]
